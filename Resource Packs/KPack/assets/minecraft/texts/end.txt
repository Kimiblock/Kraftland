Hi, PLAYERNAME.

Congratulations, you've made the last and the first achievement in Kraftland, ever.

It must be a challenging path,
Collecting logs, fighting mobs, creating your safe house, stealing goods from natural structures, crafting your finest weapons, beating the ender dragon.

You never give it up.

Minecraft is a wonderful way to explore new things, to collaborate with others, to create your own unique marks, to kill your time. Explore the entire continent. Putting your footprint on the Earth feels like magic. Every biome has its unique features. Hitting the end is not actually "The End". Every single piece of the world is unique, you never encounter the same terrain, the same badlands, the same cherry grove, the same village. Variability is the key part to Minecraft.

Create your own thing, with variability. Minecraft never ends up with "Sorry, you can't", it never lets you down in terms of possibility. You could build a computer inside of a game, isn't that amazing? There's truly unlimited possibility waiting for you to explore it. It's like the pandora magic box. We are frogs sitting at the bottom of the well, assuming the limit of the sky, imagining the width of the world.

I'd like to suggest you on behalf of the Kraftland Team, that Minecraft is not just a game, it's an entire world with a huge unknown space.

This is not the end of your Kraftland. This is just one small waypoint. When we technically passed the whole Minecraft achievement, we should treasure our precious Minecraft world, find the true value behind the simple gameplay.

Blocks make a wonderful interface, decorating the entire Minecraft world, covering caves and cliffs in the world. They reflect lights from the sun, blocking sunlights and rainfalls. They reflect the world you create.

You. You. You are alive. Remember, PLAYERNAME. You must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game. You live in a dream called Minecraft. Sometimes you dreamed yourself as a miner, tirelessly mining diamonds. Sometimes you thought yourself a human. Whom lives on a square unlimited planet, chasing a sheep for wool to make a bed. Whoever harms you in the real world, remember that the universe said I love you.

Wake up...

Thank you for playing Kraftland Minecraft server. Wish you have a wonderful day.
