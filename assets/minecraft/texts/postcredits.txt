When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just live your life inside the world; try not to bash into the walls too much.

But life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is, every single around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use.


What a computer is to me, it it's the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with, and it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.


It is stand at the intersection of technology and humanity and to make something for people that want to bring this into their lives and use it for things that make them more creative, not just make them more productive.


We have a chance, if we stay focused and choose wisely, to really continue to impact people's lives in some small way, for the better.


There's an old Wazyne Gretzky quote that I love. "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been."
